# Responsive HTML and CSS Layout (CSS Flexbox layout)

## Project Overview
This project is a simple HTML and CSS layout designed to be responsive across various device sizes, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The structure contains two main sections, **right-section** and **left-section**, along with header and footer elements. The layout is built with flexibility in mind and is styled using CSS, with media queries used to ensure responsiveness.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage, divided into two sections: right and left sections, with additional content blocks inside each.
- **style.css**: Contains all the styles applied to the layout, including flexbox for alignment, background colors, and media queries for responsiveness.

## How to View the Project

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3. The webpage will automatically adjust its layout based on the screen size.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file is divided into sections:

- **Header**: The top part of the webpage, reserved for branding, navigation, or any other site-wide content.
- **Main Container**: Contains two main sections:
  - **Right Section**: Contains a top and bottom section, which includes tabs and content blocks.
  - **Left Section**: Contains top and bottom sections with additional content like item blocks and controls.
- **Footer**: Placeholder for footer content, such as links or copyright information.

Each section has clear **comments** in the HTML to clarify the purpose of every block.

## CSS Styles

- **Flexbox Layout**: Flexbox is used for the layout of the main container, which allows the content to adjust dynamically based on the screen size.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries are used to change the layout for tablet and mobile views.


### Media Queries

- For screens smaller than **768px**, the layout stacks the right and left sections vertically.
- For screens smaller than **480px**, the padding and spacing are further reduced to accommodate smaller screens.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.

## How to Customize

- You can modify the content of the sections by updating the `div` elements in the `index.html` file.
- Update or add new styles in the `style.css` file to change the look and feel of the page.
